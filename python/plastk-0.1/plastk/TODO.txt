TO DO List for Plastk

- Documentation! Need good module-, class-, and function-level
  docstrings in all modules.  See base/parameterizedobject.py and
  misc/experiment.py for examples.

- Doctest: add support for running doctests found in documentation
  strings in module code.

- Move this list to a set of tickets in the sourceforge project tracker.

- RL-Glue support (see http://code.google.com/p/rl-glue/)

- Separate GUI from LoggingRLI. Should be a completely separate
  entity: a wrapper for an RLI or LoggingRLI 

- Clean up data file handling in LoggingRLI 
   - should be handled inside DataRecorder object. 

- Move base.params* into plastk.params (also to do in topographica)

- Clean up/reorganize rl subpackage.
  - Separate into
    - agents: containing, e.g. td.py and options.py
    - envs: containing gridworld.py, pendulum.py, etc.
    - features: containing feature extractors like tiles.py (not so
      sure about this one.  Vector quantizers are also feature
      extractors, right?
