How to start:

1) Unzip the BNNToolbox to some appropriate directory.
2) Start MATLAB and change the current directory to where you have unpacked the files (BNNTOOLBOX_DIRECTORY), using "cd BNNTOOLBOX_DIRECTORY/bnntoolbox".
3) Run "install_toolbox". This script will set pathes needed for BNNToolbox.
4) There are some demos in "examples" directory. You can start with running them. Like "example1"
5) Don't forget to download the documentation, if you don't have it.
6) Send any bugs, suggestions.
